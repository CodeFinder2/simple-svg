# Overview
*svg-writer* is a header-only library for C++11 to write SVG images programmatically, including basic support for animations.

This project creates files that can then be viewed by a applications like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). An example can be found in `src/main.cpp`.

# Alternatives
Here's a quick list of alternative libraries which may fit your needs better than this library:
- [svg_plot](https://github.com/pabristow/svg_plot): more about plotting data like time series, sin, cos, etc.
- [libboard](https://github.com/c-koi/libboard): drawing with output support for SVG/EPS/FIG with a large number of primitives
- [quicksvg](https://github.com/NAThompson/quicksvg): plots time series, graphs functions, and plots ULP accuracy - that's it
- [svg-gen](https://github.com/carlos-urena/svg-gen): allows to generate SVG files, also for 3D visualizations (2D projections), no CMake support
- [usvg](https://github.com/styluslabs/usvg): reading, writing, modifying, and rendering SVGs with basic CSS support
- [SVGChart](https://github.com/davecom/SVGChart): making SVG Charts (fork of [PPlot](http://pplot.sourceforge.net/))

This project was initially forked from [here](https://github.com/adishavit/simple-svg) (and then heavily modified) which, in turn, is a fork of the [original code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/simple-svg/).
